# PCR-Primers-RCs-Command-Line

Use PrimerBank (“google PrimerBank”) to look up PCR primers for your favorite gene
Use Search By: “NCBI Gene Symbol”, Species: “Human” to find PCR primers for your gene. 
Write a program to compute the reverse complement sequence of both the forward and reverse primer (in one program).

In this program, the primers come from the HERC2 gene.

This program is similar to another PCR Primers Reverse Complements program in another repository.  However, this program accounts for the primers and reverse primers as inputs from the command line.
